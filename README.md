# Data Science Laboratory Course 2022

This is the supervisor repo of the ["Data Science Laboratory Course"](https://dbis.ipd.kit.edu/english/3128.php) at KIT in 2022.
Students worked on two subtasks:

- the [Data Mining Cup 2022](https://www.data-mining-cup.com/dmc-2022/)
- a research problem from the field of SAT solving

The repo provides files for preparing the datasets, some basic exploration, course-internal splitting, scoring, and demo submissions for that.
